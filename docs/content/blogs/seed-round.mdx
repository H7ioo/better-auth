## Announcing our $5M seed round

I'm excited to share that we’ve raised a \$5 million seed round led by **Peak XV Partners** (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA), with participation from **Y Combinator**, **Chapter One**, **P1 Ventures** and other incredible investors.

This funding fuels the next phase of **Better Auth**.

We're obsessed with making it possible for developers to **own their auth**. We want to **democratize high quality authentication** and make rolling your own auth not just doable, but the obvious choice.

It started with building the framework. Since then, we’ve seen incredible growth and support from the community — thank you all.

Now we’re building the infrastructure on top of the framework, to provide you with:

* A unified dashboard to manage users and user analytics
* Enterprise-grade security: bot, abuse, and fraud protection
* Authentication Email and SMS service
* Fast, globally distributed session storage
* and more.

Thank you to everyone who's been part of this journey. And if you're excited about making auth accessible to everyone we're hiring!, reach out to [jobs@better-auth.com](mailto:jobs@better-auth.com).
